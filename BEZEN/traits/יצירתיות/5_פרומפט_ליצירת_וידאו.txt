Create an interactive short video about Roni, a student who feels stuck with a school presentation.

Present two paths: one where he experiments and uses creativity, and another where he sticks to old patterns and feels blocked.

End with BEZEN saying: "The world belongs to those who dare to imagine – and then create."
