Create an interactive video scenario where a teenager (Noam) faces failure and feels defeated.

Present two choices: falling into hopelessness or choosing to reflect and build a plan forward.

Introduce a wise guide named BEZEN who teaches that true hope comes with action.

End with the quote: "Hope is not passive – it’s the courage to begin again."
