Create an interactive video scenario of a teenager (Noam) who struggles with persistence. Show three scenes: trying to study, giving up due to distraction, and choosing to keep going despite difficulty.

Introduce a mystical guide named BEZEN who helps him realize that persistence isn't about perfection – it's about continuing.

Conclude with the message: "The only failure is to stop trying."
