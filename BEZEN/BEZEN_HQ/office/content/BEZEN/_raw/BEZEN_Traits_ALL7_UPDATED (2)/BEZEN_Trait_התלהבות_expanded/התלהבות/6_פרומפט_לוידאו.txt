Create an interactive video where a young protagonist is invited to join a new project.

Show two paths:
1) Jump in enthusiastically without planning and face pitfalls.
2) Plan carefully, channel enthusiasm wisely, and achieve steady progress.

Include a guide named BEZEN who explains how balanced enthusiasm drives sustainable success.

End with the quote: "Enthusiasm is the spark; planning is the fuel."
