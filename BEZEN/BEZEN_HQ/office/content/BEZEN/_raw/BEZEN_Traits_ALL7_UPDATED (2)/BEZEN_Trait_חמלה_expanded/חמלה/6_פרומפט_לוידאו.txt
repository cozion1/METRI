Create an interactive short video about a teenager (Daniel) who notices his friend is suffering emotionally but feels uncomfortable.

Present two paths: avoidance vs. approaching with empathy.

Introduce BEZEN as a mentor who teaches Daniel that compassion is about presence, not solutions.

End with: "To witness pain without fear – that is true compassion."
