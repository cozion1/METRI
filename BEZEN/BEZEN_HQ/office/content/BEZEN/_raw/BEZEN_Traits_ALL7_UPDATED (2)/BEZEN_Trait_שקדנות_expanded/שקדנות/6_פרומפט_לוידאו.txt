Create an interactive short video about a student named Roni who struggles to concentrate while doing homework.

Present two paths: one where he eliminates distractions and finishes successfully, and another where he gets sidetracked and feels overwhelmed.

End with BEZEN saying: "Diligence is quiet power — it builds real success over time."
