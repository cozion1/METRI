Create an interactive video where a character faces someone who hurt them.

Present two choices:
1) Respond with anger and escalate the conflict.
2) Offer forgiveness and open a path to reconciliation.

Include BEZEN as a guide who explains how forgiveness heals both parties.

End with the quote: "Forgiveness frees the forgiver more than the forgiven."
