Create an interactive emotional scenario of a teenager (Noam) who constantly pleases others. Show three key moments: being asked to help again despite exhaustion, choosing to say no, and discovering that true connection requires honesty.

Include a mysterious guide (BEZEN) who reflects Noam's emotions and leads him to realize the power of self-worth and setting boundaries.

End with the message: "Sometimes saying NO to others is saying YES to yourself."
