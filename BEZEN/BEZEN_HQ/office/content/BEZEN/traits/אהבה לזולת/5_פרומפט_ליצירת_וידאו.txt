Create an interactive video where a character notices a friend in distress.

Show two paths:
1) Drop personal plans to fully focus on the friend.
2) Offer support while maintaining personal balance.

Include BEZEN as a guide showing how true love for others includes self-care.

End with the quote: "To love others fully, first learn to love yourself."
