Create an interactive video about a teenager (Noam) who takes on too much work and begins to burn out. Present two paths: overworking to the point of collapse, or prioritizing and maintaining balance.

Introduce BEZEN who guides Noam to understand that true diligence includes knowing when to rest.

End with the quote: "Work with care, rest with purpose – both are signs of strength."
