Create an interactive video where a teenager (Noam) is in class, hears something unfamiliar, and feels conflicted about asking.

Present two paths: staying silent and missing out, or asking and inspiring curiosity in others.

Include a wise guide named BEZEN who encourages healthy curiosity and respectful questioning.

End with the quote: "Curiosity is not a weakness – it's the beginning of wisdom."
