Create an interactive video about a teenager (Noam) who witnesses injustice and struggles with the fear of speaking up.

Show two paths: remaining silent and feeling regret, or stepping forward and experiencing emotional growth.

Include BEZEN, a wise guide who teaches that courage begins where fear once lived.

End with the quote: "Courage is not the absence of fear – it’s choosing to act anyway."
