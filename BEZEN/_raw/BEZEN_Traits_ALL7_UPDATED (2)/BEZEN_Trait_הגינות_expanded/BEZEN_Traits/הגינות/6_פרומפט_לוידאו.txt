Create an interactive video where a character must allocate tasks in a team.

Show two paths:
1) Divide tasks equally regardless of skills and face suboptimal results.
2) Assign tasks based on strengths while ensuring everyone feels valued.

Include BEZEN as a guide explaining how true fairness balances equality and effectiveness.

End with the quote: "Fairness is giving each person what they need to succeed."
